    <p>Why hello there! Welcome to my site where I mess around with client code and demonstrate
      my lack of web development skills.</p>
    <p>I am currently funemployed, but will be joining Google shortly. Prior to that, I was an
      engineer at Workday for nearly 6 years. My experience ranges from working on backend for frontends to
      authentication/security to chatbots.</p>
    <p>Outside of work, my interests vary greatly. Pre-pandemic, I was training and competing
      in badminton at <a href="https://www.synergybadminton.com/">Synergy Badminton Academy</a>. I am now preparing
      for both the <a href="https://www.thesfmarathon.com/">SF Marathon</a> and the
      <a href="https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon">NYC Marathon</a> in 2022/2023. I am also interested in finances and
      investments. I day-traded at one point (with no losses), but now look towards long-term investing and portfolio
      management.</p>
