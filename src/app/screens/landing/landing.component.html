    <p>Why hello there! Welcome to my site where I mess around with client code and demonstrate
      my lack of web development skills.</p>
    <p>I am currently funemployed, but will be joining Google shortly. Prior to that, I was an
      engineeer at Workday for nearly 6 years. My experience ranges from working on backend for frontends to
      authentication/security to chatbots.</p>
